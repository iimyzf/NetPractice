## Level 5

  In this level we're going to work with **the router table**, which is a *set of rules that decides where the data packets travel over an IP address are heading to*. And as you know that all IP-enable devices, routers as well as switches uses the router table.
  
  And for the IP addresses this time, both machines will have the same IP address as the router `[Interface A1 = Interface R1]` and `[Interface B1 = Interface R2]` (expect for the last number of course), and **the routes** of the machines will also be the IP address of the router, what that means is that we are basically *forwarding the data packet that Machine A will send to the router* **(SAME FOR B AS WELL)**
