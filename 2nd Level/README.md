## Level 2

  For this level we are going to discover what's called a **loopback address**, which I already explained in the **README of this project**, and we know that two machines can't connect using the `127 IP address` known as **the LocalHost**, so all we gotta do is to make them connect on the `126 IP address` for example, and everything will be just fine.
