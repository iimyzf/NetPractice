## Level 6

  For this level, we need to **connect the machine to the internet**, but first we have to configure the router table, and to do so, we will give our router *the exact IP address as the machine have*, just like we did before in the previous level (exept the last number of course), once these two are connected, we will give the internet the IP of the router so our network can connect to the internet. It's a pretty straight forward level.
