## ðŸ’¡ About the project

> Since the project is a system administration related one, I'll document pretty much everything you need to know about the project from start to finish in this readme file, hope you find this usefull ðŸ˜‡

## What is an IP?

  An IP address stands for **Internet Protocol Address**, which is a set of rules for communication over the internet, such as sending emails, streaming videos, or connecting to a website, etc..., an IP address identifies a network or a device on the internet.

  An IP `(for example: 192.108.42.64)` got two important parts, which are:
  1. **The Network ID:** which is the first 3 numbers of the IP address -> `(192.108.42)`
  2. **The Host ID:** which is the last number of the IP address     -> `(64)`

## What are the types of an IP address?

  There are two important types of an IP address, which are:
  1. **Static IP address:** which stay permanent and it doesn't change, and it's used mostly for important equipement, such as (businesses, servers...)
  2. **Dynamic IP address:** which changes occasionally, and it's used for consumer equipement, such as (laptop, smartphone, tablet...)

## What is the purpose of the IP addresses?

  * The purpose of the IP address is to **handle the connection** between devices that send and recieve data all across the network.
  * The IP address uniquely **identifies every device on the internet,** without one there's no other way to contact them.
  * IP addresses allow computing devices to **communicate with destinations** like websites and streaming services, and they let websites know who is connecting.

## What is the difference between the IPv4 and the IPv6?

  * **IPv4:** deployed in the 1981, works with a 32-bits address, and has over `4.3 billion addresses` (which is a small amount of addresses compared to IPv6), so IP addresses must be reused and masked, and it uses Numeric Dot-Decimal Notation `(ex: 192.108.42.64)`, and you have to configure it manually.
  * **Ipv6:** deployed in the 1998, works with a 128-bits address, and has over `340 undecillion addresses` (which is 340 trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion [36 zeros]), so every device can have it's unique IP address, and it uses Alphanumeric Hexadecimal Notation `(ex: 2002:0de6:0001:0042:0100:8c2e:0370:7234)`, and it supports auto-configuration.

## What is TCP/IP?

  TCP/IP stands for **Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol**, which is a set of rules that guide and allow computers to communicate on a network such as the internet.
