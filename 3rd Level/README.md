## Level 3

  In this level we will discover **the switch**, and as you already know, I did also explain it in details in the **README of the project**, so feel free to go back and read it. And for the IPs in this level, we just need to change the last number as we did in the first level, and one more thing, all the network will have one Mask, which is `255.255.255.128`
