## Level 8

  For this level, we have to connect the networks to the internet, first thing to notice beside that we have 4 networks, is that we got the **/28 Mask**, and as you know that `the /28 mask can have 16 subnets, each with a 16 diffrent IP addresses` *(including the host and broadcast ones of course)*, so we can use the /28 Mask all over the networks without any problems, and for the IP addresses, we will basically do the same thing again as we did in the last level.
