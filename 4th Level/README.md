## Level 4

  For this level, a new member joining us in our journey ðŸ˜‡ which is **the router**, and again and as you already know I explained it in details in the **README of the project**, so make sure to give it a read firt, and for the IP addresses this time, we will basically do the same thing as before, we will *change the last number of the IP address*. And if you went and read about the router, you will find that it's job is to connect multiple LANs to the internet to make a WAN (more details in the readme).
